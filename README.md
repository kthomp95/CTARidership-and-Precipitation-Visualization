This contains my contribution to a project visualizing how weather and events impact CTA ridership using the R library Shiny.
I have included a .png file which is a screenshot of the app's interface, a zip which contains the code to run the app in R, data, and the necessary shape files to build the map. I have also included the process of data cleaning and visualization exploration both as the R file as well as a knitted HTML.

To run the app, simply extract the zip. Make sure the necessary libraries are installed and run app in R Studio.
